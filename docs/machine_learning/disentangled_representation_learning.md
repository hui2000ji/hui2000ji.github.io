- Sufficiency: $I(y;z) = I(y;x)$
- Invariance: $n \perp y \rightarrow I(n;z) = 0$, where $n$ denotes nuisance factors.
- Minimality: $\min I(x; z)$
- Disentangling: $\mathrm{TC}(z): \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(p(z) \Vert \prod_i p(z_i))$

### Merits of Disentangled Representation

While there is no widely-accepted formalized notion of disentanglement (yet), the key intuition is that a disentangled representation should separate the distinct, informative factors of variations in the data[^3].

Disentangled representations offer several advantages[^9]:

- **Invariance**: it is easier to derive representations that are invariant to nuisance factors by simply marginalizing over the corresponding dimensions
- **Transferability**: they are arguably more suitable for transfer learning as most of the key underlying generative factors appear segregated along feature dimensions
- **Interpretability**: a human expert may be able to assign meanings to the dimensions
- **Conditioning and intervention**: they allow for interpretable conditioning and/or intervention over a subset of the latents and observe the effects on other nodes in the graph.

Current deep learning common practices are generally not disentangled, for instance, state-of-the-art deep learning models trained on speech data failed to capture basic conceps such as distributions on phonemes[^8].

## Metrics of disentanglement

> Adapted from the benchmark paper by F. Locatello et al.[^2], 2019.

This section discusses the metrics of disentanglement. Readers interested only in learning disentangled representation can skip this section.

### $\beta$-VAE Metric

The $\beta$-VAE metric[^4] measures disentanglement as the accuracy of a linear classifier that predicts the index of a fixed factor of variation.

![beta-VAE-metric](../assets/images/DRL-beta-VAE.png){: style="width: 60%" .image-center }

Over a batch of $L$ samples, each pair of data points has a fixed value for one target generative factor $y$ (here $y$ is scale) and differs on all others. A linear classifier is then trained to identify the target factor using the average pairwise difference $\zbf^b_{\mathrm{diff}}$ in the latent space over $L$ samples.

This metric has several drawbacks as pointed out by follow-up works[^5]<sup>,</sup>[^6]:

- It is sensitive to hyperparameters of the linear classifier optimization
- Classifying data-generating factors is not intuitive because factors can be represented as a linear combination of multiple independent latent dimensions[^5]. Contrary to this point, [^6] believes a truly disentangled model should only contain one latent variable related to each factor, and argues that this metric lacks axis-alignment detection.
- It has a failure mode: when $K-1$ out of $K$ factors are disentangled, it outputs 100%.

### FactorVAE Metric

The FactorVAE metric[^5] uses a majority vote classifier on a different feature vector, namely, the argmin of the per-dimension empirical variance.

![FactorVAE-Metric](../assets/images/DRL-FactorVAE.png)

### Mutual Information Gap (MIG)

Mutual Information Gap (MIG)[^6] measures for each factor of variation the normalized gap in mutual information between the highest and second highest coordinate in $z$.

$$
\mathrm{MIG} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{1}{H(v_k)} \Big(
    I_n(z_{j^{(k)}}; v_k) - \max_{j \ne j^{(k)}} I_n(z_{j}; v_k)
\Big)
$$

where $j^{(k)} = \argmax_j I_n(z_j;v_k)$. MIG is bounded by 0 and 1.

**Estimation of $I_n(z_j;v_k)$** &emsp; Let $n \in \{1, 2, \dots, N\}$ be the data point index and $\Xcal_{v_k}$ be the support of $p(n|v_k)$. We make the following assumptions:

- Model: $q(z, v) = \sum_x p(v)p(x|v)q(z|x)$.
- The inference distribution $q(z_j|x)$ can be sampled from and is known for all $j$.
- The generating process $p(n|v_k)$ can be sampled from and is known.
- Simplifying assumption: $p(v_k)$ and $p(n|v_k)$ are quantized.

Then the mutual information can be estimated as the following:

$$
\begin{align}
 & I_n(z_j;v_k) \\
=& \E_{q(z_j, v_k)} \left( \log \sum_{n=1}^N q(z_j, v_k, n) - \log q(z_j) - \log p(v_k) \right) \\
=& \E_{p(v_k)p(n^\prime|v_k)q(z_j|n^\prime)} \left( \log \sum_{n=1}^N p(v_k)p(n|v_k)q(z_j|n) - \log q(z_j) - \log p(v_k) \right) \\
=& \E_{p(v_k)p(n^\prime|v_k)q(z_j|n^\prime)} \left( \log \sum_{n=1}^N p(n|v_k)q(z_j|n) \right) H(z_j) \\
=& \E_{p(v_k)p(n^\prime|v_k)q(z_j|n^\prime)} \left( \log \sum_{n \in \Xcal_{v_k}} p(n|v_k)q(z_j|n) \right) H(z_j) \\
\end{align}
$$

### Modularity & Explicitness
**Background: An Explicit Definition of Disentanglement**

In the paper[^7], the authors first give an explicit definition of Disentanglement:

- *Modular*: each dimension of the representation conveys information about at most one factor
- *Compact*: a given factor is associated with only one or a few dimensions in the representation
- *Explicit*: there is a simple (e.g., linear) mapping from the representation to the value of a factor

They use this definition to analyse the [$\beta$-VAE Metric](#beta-vae-metric) and the [FactorVAE Metric](#factorvae-metric), and found that the former consider only modularity, while the latter consider modularity and compactness. They argue that compactness is not a desiderata for disentangled representation learning since

- Forcing compactness can affect the representation’s utility, e.g. $(\sin \theta, \cos \theta)$ vs $\theta$.
- Compactness requirement highly constrain the solution space, while allowing redundancy enables many equivalent solutions.

Based on these claims, the authors quantify modularity and explicitness in their metric.

**The Modularity Metric**

Note that for ideally modular representation, each latent dimension would have high mutual information with a single factor. Let $m_{jk} = I(z_j;v_k)$ and $\theta_j = \max_k m_{jk}$. Define a template vector $\mathbf{t}_j$ such that 

$$
t_{jk} = \begin{cases}
\theta_j & \text{if }k=\argmax_{k^\prime} m_{jk^\prime}\\
0        & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
The observed deviation from the template is given by

$$
\delta_j = \frac{\sum_k (m_{jk} - t_{jk})^2}{\theta_j^2(K-1)}
$$

A deviation of 0 indicates perfect modularity and 1 indicates that the $j$-th dimension has equal mutual information with every factor.

Thus, they use $1 - \delta_j$ as a modularity score for latent dimension $j$ and the mean over $j$ as the modularity score for the representation.

**The Explicitness Metric**

For explicitness, the author fit a one-versus-rest logistic-regression classifier that takes the entire representation as input, and record the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of that classifier. The explicitness score is defined as the mean of AUROC over all $K$ factors and all possible values of the factors.

### DCI Disentanglement Score

The DCI Disentanglement Metric[^10] computes the entropy of the normalized importance of each latent dimension $j$ for predicting the value of a factor of variation $v_k$. The metric is calculated as follows:

- Train $K$ regressors to predict data-generating factors $v_k$ given latent representation $z$.
- Construct a matrix $R$ of relative importance  where $R_{jk}$ denotes the relative importance (e.g. absolute value of the LASSO weight) of $z_j$ in predicting $v_k$.
- Devide $R$ by its row-wise sum to obtain normalized importance $P$, where $P_{jk} = \frac{R_{jk}}{\sum_{k^\prime} R_{jk}}$. Note that the "disentanglement" here is equivalent to the "modularity" in the [Modularity & Explicitness Metric](#modularity--explicitness).
- Calculate the entropy of the normalized importance $H(P_j) = -\sum_{k=1}^K P_{jk}\log P_{jk}$ for each latent dimension $j$.
- Obtain the DCI Disentanglement Metric by weighted average of per-dimension disentanglement $D = \sum_j \rho_j (1-H(P_j))$, where $\rho_j = \frac{\sum_k R_{jk}}{\sum_{jk}R_{jk}}$.

### SAP Score
The SAP Score[^9] is the average difference of the prediction error of the two most predictive latent dimensions for each factor. The metric is calculated as follows:

- Train $K$ regressors/classifiers to predict data-generating factors $v_k$ given the $j$-th latent dimension $z_j$.
- Construct a score matrix $R$ where $S_{jk}$ denotes the relative importance (specifically, $R^2$ score for linear regression and balanced classification accuracy for thresholded classification) of $z_j$ in predicting $v_k$. For inactive (low varince) dimensions we take $S_{jk}$ to be zero for all $k$s.
- For each factor $k$, take the difference of top two entries of vector $S_{\cdot k}$.
- Obtain the SAP score as the mean of these differences over all factors.

Note that SAP focuses on compactness, and thus a high SAP score does not rule out not-modular representations (one latent dimension capturing two or more generative factors well). Further, a low SAP score does not rule out good modularity in cases when two (or more) latent dimensions might be correlated strongly with the same generative factor and poorly with other generative factors.

### Metric Agreement
![metric agreement](../assets/images/DRL-metric-agreement.png){: style="width: 70%" .image-center }
Taken from the benchmark paper[^2].

The authors observe that all metrics except [Modularity](#modularity--explicitness) seem to be correlated strongly on the datasets dSprites, Color-dSprites and Scream-dSprites and mildly on the other data sets. There appear to be two pairs among these metrics that capture particularly similar notions: the [$\beta$-VAE](#beta-vae-metric) and the [FactorVAE](#factorvae-metric) metric as well as the [MIG](#mutual-information-gap-mig) and [DCI Disentanglement](#dci-disentanglement-score).

## Regularizing AutoEncoders for Disentanglement

### $\beta$-VAE: Constrain the Bottleneck Capacity

The $\beta$-VAE[^4] introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ in front of the KL regularizer of the VAE ELBO to constrain the capacity of the VAE bottleneck. By setting $\beta > 1$, the encoder distribution will be forced to better match the factorized unit Gaussian prior. This often results in decreased reconstruction capabilities.

$$
\E_{p(\xbf)} \left[
    \E_{q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf)}\log p_\theta(\xbf|\zbf) - \beta \KL(q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf) \Vert p(\zbf))
\right]
$$

In a follow-up work[^11], the authors propose to progressively increase the bottleneck capacity, so that the encoder can focus on learning one factor of variation at the time and eventually capture more factors of variations than $\beta$-VAE:

$$
\E_{p(\xbf)} \left[
    \E_{q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf)}\log p_\theta(\xbf|\zbf) - \gamma |\KL(q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf) \Vert p(\zbf)) - C|
\right]
$$

where $C$ is annealed from zero to some value large enough to produce good representation.

### FactorVAE and $\beta$-TCVAE: Penalize the total correlation

Note that the KL regularizer term can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{align}
 & \E_{p(\xbf)} \KL(q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf) \Vert p(\zbf)) \\
=& \E_{q(\zbf, \xbf)} \log \left( \frac{q(\zbf|\xbf)}{p(\zbf)}\frac{q(\zbf)}{q(\zbf)} \right) \\
=& \E_{q(\zbf, \xbf)} \log \frac{q(\zbf|\xbf)}{q(\zbf)} + \E_{q(\zbf)} \log \frac{q(\zbf)}{p(\zbf)} \\
=& I_q(\xbf; \zbf) + \KL(q(\zbf) \Vert p(\zbf)) \\
=& I_q(\xbf; \zbf) + \E_{q(\zbf)} \log \left( \frac{q(\zbf)}{\prod_j p(z_j)} \frac{\prod_j q(z_j)}{\prod_j q(z_j)} \right) \\
=& I_q(\xbf; \zbf) + \KL(q(\zbf) \Vert \prod_j(q(z_j))) + \sum_j\KL(q(z_j) \Vert p(z_j))
\end{align}
$$

where $q(\zbf) = \sum_\xbf p(\xbf) q(\zbf|\xbf)$ is the aggregated posterior. Kim and Minh [^5] argues that penalizing $I_q(\xbf; \zbf)$ is neither necessary nor desirable for disentanglement. Instead, they opt to minimize the *total correlation* of $q(\zbf)$ (the second term in the last line of above equation), yielding the following objective:

$$
\E_{p(\xbf)} \left[
    \E_{q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf)}\log p_\theta(\xbf|\zbf) - \KL(q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf) \Vert p(\zbf))
\right] - \gamma \KL(q(\zbf) \Vert \prod_j q(z_j))
$$

**FactorVAE** &emsp; Kim and Minh [^5] propose to estimate the total correlation using the density ratio trick, i.e. train an additional classifier $D$ to predict if the latent comes from $q(\zbf)$ or $\prod_j q(z_j)$. Latent samples from $\prod_j q(z_j)$ are obtained by randomly permuting the dimensions within latents inferred in a minibatch.

**$\beta$-TCVAE**[^6] &emsp; $\beta$-TCVAE optimizes the same objective as FactorVAE, but uses a tractable biased Monte-Carlo estimate for the total correlation. Let $\Bcal_M = (\xbf_1, \dots, \xbf_M)$ be a minibatch of size $M$ sampled i.i.d. from the training set of size $N$. Therefore, $p(\Bcal_M) = (\frac{1}{N})^M$. Let $r(\Bcal_M|n)$ denote the probability of a sampled minibatch where one of the elements is fixed to be index $n$, thus $p(r(\Bcal_M|n)) = (\frac{1}{N})^{M-1}$. Then

$$
\begin{align}
 & \E_{q(\zbf)} \log q(\zbf) \\
=& \E_{q(\zbf, n)} \log \E_{p(\Bcal_M)} \left[\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M q(\zbf | n_m) \right] \\
\ge& \E_{q(\zbf, n)} \log \E_{r(\Bcal_M|n)} \left[ \frac{p(\Bcal_M)}{r(\Bcal_M|n)}\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M q(\zbf | n_m) \right] \\
=& \E_{q(\zbf, n)} \log \E_{r(\Bcal_M|n)} \left[ \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{m=1}^M q(\zbf | n_m) \right] \\
\end{align}
$$

The inequality is due to $r$ having a support that is a subset of that of $p$. $\E_{q(z_j)} \log q(z_j)$ is estimated in the same way.

### DIP-VAE and AAE: Disentangle the Inferred Prior

The authors[^9] argue that a disentangled generative model requires a disentangled inferred prior (aggregated posterior) $q(\zbf)$. They propose to optimize

$$
\E_{p(\xbf)} \left[
    \E_{q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf)}\log p_\theta(\xbf|\zbf) - \KL(q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf) \Vert p(\zbf))
\right] - \lambda \Dcal(q(\zbf) \Vert p(\zbf))
$$

where $\Dcal$ is some arbitrary divergence. Since the additional term is intractable, we could either use [variational formulation of KL-divergence](../representation_learning_with_mutual_information_maximization/#variational-representation-of-the-f-divergence) as in Adversarial AutoEncoeders (AAEs) or simply perform moment matching as in DIP-VAE.

**DIP-VAE** &emsp; Matching the covariance of $q(\zbf)$ and $p(\zbf)$ amounts to decorrelating the dimensions of $\zbf \sim q_\phi(\zbf)$ if $p(\zbf) = \Ncal(0, I)$. By [the law of covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_covariance), the covariance of $\zbf \sim q(\zbf)$ is given by

$$
\Cov_{q_\phi(\zbf)}\zbf = \E_{p(\xbf)} \Cov_{q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf)}\zbf + \Cov_{p(\xbf)} \E_{q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf)}\zbf
$$

where $\E_{q_\phi(\zbf|\xbf)}\zbf$ and $\Cov_{q_phi(\zbf|\xbf)}\zbf$ are functions of the random variable $\xbf$ ($\zbf$ is marginalized over). For VAE models with Gaussian posterior of $\zbf$, i.e. $q_\phi(\zbf, \xbf) = \Ncal(\mu_\phi(\xbf), \Sigma_\phi(\xbf))$, the covariance of $\zbf \sim q(\zbf)$ reduces to

$$
\Cov_{q_\phi(\zbf)}\zbf = \E_{p(\xbf)} \Sigma_\phi(\xbf) + \Cov_{p(\xbf)} \mu_\phi(\xbf)
$$

which we want to be close to the identity matrix. We choose entry-wise squared $l_2$-norm as the measure of proximity.

Further, $\Sigma_\phi(\xbf)$ is often taken as diagonal, which means that cross-correlations (off-diagonals) between the latents are due to only $\Cov_{p(\xbf)} \mu_\phi(\xbf)$. This suggests two possible options for the disentangling regularizer:

- *DIP-VAE-I* &emsp; Regularizing only $\Cov_{p(\xbf)} \mu_\phi(\xbf)$. The objective becomes
 
$$
\max_{\theta, \phi} \ELBO(\theta, \phi) - \lambda_1 \sum_{i \ne j} \left[\Cov_{p(\xbf)\mu_{\phi}(\xbf)}\right]^2_{ij} - \lambda_2 \sum_i \left(\left[\Cov_{p(\xbf)} \mu_\phi(\xbf)\right]_{ii} - 1\right)^2
$$

- *DIP-VAE-II* &emsp; Regularizing $\Cov_{q_\phi(\zbf)}\zbf$. The objective is

$$
\max_{\theta, \phi} \ELBO(\theta, \phi) - \lambda_1 \sum_{i \ne j} \left[\Cov_{q_\phi(\zbf)}\zbf\right]^2_{ij} - \lambda_2 \sum_i \left(\left[\Cov_{q_\phi(\zbf)}\zbf\right]_{ii} - 1\right)^2
$$

The authors argue that in datasets where the number of generative factors is less than the latent dimension, DIP-VAE-II is more suitable than DIP-VAE-I as keeping all dimensions active (optimizing towards $\Var_{q_\phi(\zbf)}z_i=1$ for all $i$'s) might result in splitting of an attribute across multiple dimensions, hurting the goal of disentanglement.

**AAE** &emsp; Adversarial autoencoders attaches an adversarial discriminator on top of the latent representation of an autoencoder to match the aggregated posterior $q(\zbf)$ to an arbitrary easy-to-sample prior $p(\zbf)$.

The network is trained jointly in two phases:

1. In the *reconstruction* phase, the autoencoder minimizes the reconstruction error of the inputs.
2. In the *regularization* phase, the discriminator is first updated to tell apart the true samples (generated using the prior) from the generated samples (the hidden codes computed by the encoder). Then the encoder is updated to confuse the discriminator.

![Adversarial Autoencoders](../assets/images/DRL-AAE.png)
AAE has many variants aimed for different learning settings. (left) Adversarial Autoencoders; (middle) Semi-supervised AAE; (right) AAE for Dimensionality Reduction

- *Semi-supervised AAE* has two adversarial discriminator: one for label $y$ and another for style representation $\zbf$.
    1. In the *reconstruction* phase, the autoencoder minimize the reconstruction error of the inputs on an unlabeled mini-batch.
    2. In the *regularization* phase, each of the discriminators is updated to tell apart the true samples (generated using the Categorical and Gaussian priors) from the generated samples (the hidden codes computed by the encoder). Then the encoders are updated to confuse their discriminators.
    3. In the *classification* phase, the encoder is updated to minimize the cross-entropy cost on a labeled mini-batch.
- *AAE for Unsupervised Clustering* has the same architecture as the Semi-supervised AAE, while it does not have the classification phase.
- *AAE for Dimensionality Reduction* aims to learn a good representation that encodes both the label and style information. The final representation is achieved by adding the distributed representation of the cluster head with the style representation, both $n$-dimensional. The cluster head representation is obtained by multiplying the $m$ dimensional one-hot class label vector by an $m \times n$ matrix $W_C$. We introduce an additional cost function that linearly penalizes the Euclidean distance between every two cluster heads if they are greater than a threshold $\eta$.
