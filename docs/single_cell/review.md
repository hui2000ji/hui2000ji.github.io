## Recurring themes of single-cell data science

### Varying levels of resolution

> When drawing maps of cell types and states, it is important that sc-seq methods
> 
> - have a structure that recapitulates both tissue development and tissue organization
> - account for continuous cell states in addition to discrete cell types (i.e., reflecting cell state trajectories within cell types and smooth transitions between cell types, as observed in tissue generation)
> - allow for choosing the level of resolution flexibly; and (iv)
> - include biological and functional annotation wherever available and helpful in the intended functional context.

### Quantifying uncertainty of measurements and analysis results

> The amount of material sampled from single cells is considerably less than that used in bulk experiments.
> The increase in resolution due to sc-seq also means a reduction of the stability of the supporting signals.
> This in turn implies that data becomes substantially more uncertain and tasks so far considered routine, such as single nucleotide variation (SNV) calling in bulk sequencing, require considerable methodological care with sc-seq data.

### Scaling to higher dimensionalities
